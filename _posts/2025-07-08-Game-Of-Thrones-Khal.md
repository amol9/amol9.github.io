Some analysis of the character in GoT, Khal Drogo is due.

It is an interesting character. In the TV series, he is shown as a strong, tall character, with bare chest and a clan. But, I think, the book tells a lot more about him.

I think, in the book, he is narrated as a character who is a leader and has never lost a battle. And, somehow, I sense that, such a character will always be so. What is such a character? I think, such a character is a combination of a secure mindset, bodily strength, and neuroticism. I think, the neuroticism may be deduced from the story background that Khal belongs to a clan that is nomadic in nature. As such, these people may be tribal in nature. And, tribal people have been described as neurotic in many texts, Freud if I have to recall a name.

Such a character may be described as 'undefeatable'. It may be that the combination of neuroticism, secure mindset and bodily strength is undefeatable in the world.
