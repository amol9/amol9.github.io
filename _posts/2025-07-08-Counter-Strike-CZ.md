There are some things to be noted down about the experience in the game, Counter Strike: Condition Zero. After playing for some time, some observations can be made. These are about the bot behaviour.

1. I have noticed something. I employed a particulat strategy of grouping with the teammates when playing, with bots. All the players on both the sides were bots. I would go with the bots. And, I would make a particular formation, with mostly me in the center. It worked. As a team, we could perform better. Of course, there is the obvious war rule, the numbers win. So, this strategy worked, more than once.

It was interesting to note, though, that, after the rounds were complete in a particular map, when the map was changed, the strategy was mirrored, in the team opposite to mine, among the bots. The bots in the opposite team made a similar formation.

It may be that the movements of me and my team (bots) were recorded and were used to improve the strategy of the opposite team, or, to keep the game interesting.

2. There is one more observation. I noticed it today. I have been observing for a while, that, it is possible with a very good probability that the bot's shooting is based on the visual input, that, if a bot sees you first, he shoots you first. You are then possibly more likely to get killed. It is all visual based. The game engine, or, the computer graphics part of the game must be taking care of that. There is no way around, no way to win, if a bot sees you first. mostly ever. This may be against the eexpectation of the bot behaviour to be human like, with a human possibly not being so accurate on the first view.

Today, I saw a case. I heard footsteps. They were behind me. I thought it was a teammate, and did not look back. The footsteps kept coming for a bit, like some 10 seconds. I did not look back. I waited by a window a bit, not looking back. Then, in a few seconds, I was shot, from the back, I saw the opposite team member moving behind me, after I was killed, in the post kill view.

There was an idea after that. That, the bot tracking is solely based on the visuals, so, if I py attention to the sounds, and guess the direction of it, it is possible to take a shot better.
