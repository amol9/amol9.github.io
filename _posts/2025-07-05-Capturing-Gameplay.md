title: Capturing Gameplay
---

I am trying to capture the gameplay of Counter Strike. I have tried a couple of options in terms of capturing tools. But, none of them have worked. The Windows Steps Recorder is only for capturing steps, with the screen captured only in between, in the static image format. Then, I tried Screen Recorder from Windows Store. It did not capture the gameplay. After that, I tried the Bandicam screen recorder. I tried with the Intel drivers and with the Game Capture mode, but, it did not work.
