title: Counter Strike: Game Analysis

I have been playing counter strike for a while now. I have been playing it for some one and a half month now, after some two decades, with only a little bit in between. It is a game with near constant action.

There is something I have noticed about the game. I have written about it before too. That, the bot players mimic the human players behaviour. There is more to be added to it. I guess, that, the human actions and kills are actually queued in some kind of list and are used by the bot players. There may not be much advanced logic to it, as my imagination would have guessed it, long time ago, decades ago. I might have wrongly assumes that, the bot or computer players are controlled by some kind of advanced logic, guided by AI, etc. I mean the old CS curriculum AI, not the current market AI. But, it may not be so. The bot logic may be much more rudimentary. I have been trying to guess why I got killed many times. Sometimes, I just come up with a simple explanation, from the guess of the bot logic being rudimentary, that, I get killed because of mimicked human kill, which was queued on bot play, as a logic of the opposing player, that is me, getting killed. It may not have much to do with the aiming.

Of course, it is a guess. And in the absence of an actual implementation of such kind, it may be a useful guess, in order to come up with a simple game logic.
