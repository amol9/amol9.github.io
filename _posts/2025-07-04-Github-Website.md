I continued work on making the website, amol9.com static. I checked out the github repo, amol9.com. There was some struggle with the branches. Then, I did the branch renaming and adding of new branch on the github website. Then, I tried to test, by going to amol9.com. It is still showing the old site, from the renamed branch. It might take some time, probably, for the website to go blank, without pages, as the new 'gh-pages' branch contains nothing. Only readme file is present. That needs to be tested, if that file shows on amol9.com, then, I can continue my work on making the website static.
