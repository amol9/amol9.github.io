I have been watching the videos from the movie, 'The Bourne Identity' for a while now, it could be easily some 6 months of it. What is it that is so interesting in this movie? Does the word 'interesting' make sense here?

I can start with the word 'identity'. I suppose everyone in this world is in pursuit of his/her own identity. That may be the defining feature of everyone's life. All of one's actions may be dedicated to the single task of finding out who one is. This movie, its concept may be actually an exact opposite idea of such a pursuit. I will be getting into the details.
