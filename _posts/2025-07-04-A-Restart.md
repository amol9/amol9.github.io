title: A Restart
---

I have decided to restart my activties in the department of code/web again, after many years. I am going to start with the publishing of some stories I have written. I am going to publish those on my website, amol9.com. I had to look up my own repos on github, to start on this. I have to admit, it felt like a bit of work, to get into github, and to look up the names of the projects. I found the relevant projects. There are two of importance, amol9.com and amol9.github.io. I am going to revive my website and I am going to blog as I do it, and, also I am going to blog about various other technical things that I do.
