I have been having some tough times with git. I am not sure if it's me or if it's git. It may be that, I just don't get the version control system. I have had problems with other version control systems before.

There is a plenty of messages emitted which makes me want to kill myself, sometimes, slowly, sometimes, immediately. There is something like, "Failed to merge repository, please check branch strategy, or, rebase the current branch to remote". What is this? This is too many verbs. And, I have never gotten around this 'rebase' thing, and, I think I'll never be able to. The closest I can get to 'rebase' is to find the person who came up with this word, and rebase his face, locally.

The above is a joke.
