While I wait forever to  download 60GB games on the game software, Pressure, there is something that needs to be noted. What if one was to port these games into the world of p*rn?

### The Hunter > The HuntHer

Of course, this would take place in a jungle, preferrably in a cabin.

### Counter Strike > CountHer Strike

I may have seen this, this might have involved terrorists, and, no counter terrorists. Of course, the terrorists won.

### The Last Of Us > The Last Of Bus

This may be more serious, for details one may read a newspaper.

### Half Life > Half Wife

This may be related to the world of robotics and radiation, one can leave the imagination to sci-fi genre of p*rn.

### Asphalt: Airborne > A**Fault HeirBorn

As the word 'heir' is involved, one may chalk up the fantasy to the kind of GoT.
