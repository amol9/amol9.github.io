title: Continuing On Github Website
---

This morning, I continued on the github website related activities. On the new branch, I added 'index.html, and, 'CNAME'. Both the parts did not work. The domain name is still showing the old website, from the renamed github branch. It is not showing the pages from the new branch titled 'gh-pages'.

Next, unrelated, I started to automate the post file creation for the github blog. The blog is based on Ruby/Jekyll. The script is for Windows, hence, the use of powershell. I learnt and used a few powewrshell concepts, like 'script', use of extension 'ps1', 'Get-Date', variables, 'Read-Host'. The script development is in progress.
